# curling-manger
PyQT5 based Curling League Manger App

To run this application you need to start launch the MainWindow.py file located in the qt_windows directory. 

My setup.py file can be used to generate a tar.gz archive for distribution. I ran it using 'python3 setup.py sdist'
which created the dist/curling-manager-1.0.0.tar.gz archive.
